CS50 - 2020 solutions
=====================
Here is my all Harvard CS50 2020 problem sets solutions.

> A quick word on [Academic Honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/syllabus/#academic-honesty). While these solutions will help you to get through the course without too much effort, you should do your best to figure out a working solution yourself before taking a look at any of my solutions. Investing your time and energy into solving the problem sets yourself is in my opinion the only way to eventual mastery.

In many weeks you had the choice between a more (harder) and less (easier) comfortable exercise. In each of these situations I decided to challenge myself by only doing the harder problems.

Tracks
----------
In order to decide what kind of final project I wanted to do, I did all tracks, including: Android app developmet, web development and game development.

- [Tracks](/tracks)
  * [Android](/tracks/android)
  * [Game](/tracks/game)
  * [Web](/tracks/web)  


Final Project
----------

Will come in the future in different repo.
