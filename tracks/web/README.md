## Homepage
The homepage project is a website about obstacle racing, a hobby of mine, and consists of some pages, including:
- Homepage
- Page about big organisations in this sport
- A page with some blogs written by me about this subject
- An about page, with information about me.
- A contact page, where people can submit questions. (Back-end of this is currently not set up)
