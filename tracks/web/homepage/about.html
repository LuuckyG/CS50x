                                I always have been active, doing multiple sports.
                                I started with tennis and soccer and later switched to the gym and rowing.
                                Since I was 15, I started going to the gym to get stronger and gain some
                                muscles. But after some years it started to become somewhat dull.
                                The goal of going to the gym is often to look good, but the muscles or looks
                                do not provide you with useful physical capabilities. I did not feel I was
                                getting fitter by doing only strength exercises, but I don’t enjoy doing
                                cardio in the gym. Thus, I went outside for cardio and started running next
                                to the strength training. Then, by accident we stumbled upon a Strong Viking race
                                and we were immediately enthusiastic about it. I started with obstacle running in 2017 and after
                                my first obstacle run, I immediately fell in love with it. As I am a competitive person by nature,
                                I started focussed on the competitive aspect of the sport.
