                                    <h5 id="intro-001">How would I describe my first Elite wave OCR race?</h5>
                                    <p>In one word: tough. It was the hardest thing I had done physically ever. But would I do it again? Hell yeah! I enjoyed myself, learned more about my mental toughness, had the chance to once again compete in this wonderful sport and on top of that I became a lot fitter the past year training for this race. So yeah, I would happily do this again.</p>

                                    <h5 id="race-prep">Preparing for the Elite wave</h5>
                                    <p>One year ago I completed my first OCR course, 20th of May 2017. It was the Hills edition of the Strong Viking run in Amsterdam and was about 14 kilometres. It was a blast to tackle the obstacles and complete the race together but I felt like I could do more. That’s when I decided to compete at the Elite start wave exactly one year later. </p>
                                    <p>Flash forward to 20th May 2018. Race day again. I had been nervous the past two weeks but today I felt ready and strong. Even though the two weeks leading up to the event were not completely as planned and resulted in, what I thought was a minor injury of my Achilles tendon. Later I would find out it in fact was a major injury... </p>
                                    <p>So when we were called to the start, I went up there with a taped ankle but also with great desire and adrenaline rush, ready to compete.  Five days before I was not able to run 2 km without pain, so I decided to give it all in the beginning and not care about the later part of the race. As there was still a great change that I would have to quit either way.</p>

                                    <h5 id="start-race">Ready, Set, Sprint!</h5>
                                    <p>So off we go. The start was furious. Everyone fighting for a good starting position, racing at a ridiculous pace (15+ km/hour). But I managed to claim a spot in the middle of the pack, feeling very excited!</p>
                                    <p>The first couple of obstacles were long and heavy, including a hill mud crawl and dragon tails. But the obstacles went great the first 4 km or so and I had no penalties yet (luckily). Then it was time for the hammer throw.. We did not specifically trained for this obstacle and this sadly leaded to the first penalty of the day, a penalty lap. But OK, no big deal, we were still in it. </p>
                                    <p>After 8 km we had the river crossing. This obstacle was not the problem in itself, but the fact that you bring your legs on the rope helping you to cross the river was. This triggered the pain in my Achilles tendon. But I persisted and ran on. After a while I forget about the injury and it went fine from that point on. However, another difficulty arrived: muscle cramps in my calves.</p>
                                    <p>This was about the half way point and I was 90 minutes in the race. The warm weather, the limited drinks stops and the lack of nutrients did not help with cramps at all. I had to walk up hills, the stop to stretch multiple times during the race and aerial obstacles were a pain in the ass. Soon as I lifted my legs from the ground, the cramp would kick in, making it incredibly hard to complete the obstacle. To my surprise, I only failed 2/54 obstacles  due to the cramps (hanging walls and the low rig). </p>

                                    <h5 id="race-recap">How do I look back at the race?</h5>
                                    <p>In the end I had failed 5 obstacles in total. The peg board and the flying monkey bar were the fourth and fifth failed obstacle. I finished the course in just over 3 hours. I was happy how the race went considering the circumstances. I learned many thing from competing in this event. First, you have to be really fit to compete in the top, and I mean really really fit. These athletes train full time for this and it was an honour to compete with and against them. It also made me hungry to train even harder next year and come back even stronger. </p>
                                    <p>Because in the end of the day it is all about improving yourself and reaching your own goals. </p>

                                    <h5 id="intro-002">Introduction</h5>
                                    <p>From the moment you signed up to participate in an obstacle run, training starts. But how to train and what to train for an obstacle run? On this page we will give some training tips and focus areas that will come in handy on race day.</p>
                                    <p>When entering the race area on race day, you will notice a great difference in fitness level between participants. A large part of the runners are not very experienced runners and just want to have fun on the course. As many runners participate for fun and obstacle races is a way for groups of friends to become healthier together.</p>
                                    <p>This, however, creates big opportunities for the more serious and fit participants, who are looking to crush the obstacle course. If you want to see how you match up with other racers and want to be in the best shape possible on race day, then your training should at minimal include the following fitness aspects: endurance, overall strength and certain techniques.</p>
            
                                    <h5 id="prep">Race preparation</h5>
                                    <p>Before you start making up your training plan for the upcoming months, you need to decide on certain things:
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Do you want to run a short or a long race?</li>
                                            <li>How well are you able run a distance similar to the race?</li>
                                            <li>Are you currently able to complete the obstacles?</li>
                                            <li>What is your current level of fitness?</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    </p>
                                    <p> Additionally, and maybe most importantly, what are your personal goals? What do you want to accomplish in both training and race? When you know your current fitness level is and you have clear goals to aim for, you are ready to start training.</p>
            
                                    <h5 id="ocr-training">Obstacle Run Training</h5>
                                    <p>The time needed to train for completing the obstacle race depends on your current fitness level. If you already have some experience in running or strength training, you should give yourself at least 6-8 weeks of specific training for the obstacle race. If you are a beginner in running or strength training (or both), you probably will need at least 12-16 weeks to train for the race.</p>
                                    <p>Most people competing at an obstacle run have mostly one of the two following sports backgrounds. Either you are a seasoned runner who is looking for an extra challenge by conquering an obstacle course, or you are a gym beast who is looking for a new challenge to test and show his or her fitness abilities. </p>
                                    <p>Based on your background, your training will focus on different aspects. If you have experience with running, the running part of the obstacle race should not be the main focus, as this is your personal strength. You should keep your running up to par but you do not need to improve on it. However, you might lack some upper body strength needed to complete the obstacles and therefore your training should focus on increasing your upper body strength. If you are more of a strength athlete, the focus of training should be on endurance. Not only should you incorporate loads of running (depending on the race distance) to increase overall cardio.</p>
            
                                    <h5 id="strength-training">Strength Training</h5>
                                    <p>Your strength training should focus more on aerobic performance than just bodybuilding and raw strength. You can do this with full body or HIIT workouts. Make sure that the exercises are performed on an intensity level which you can sustain for a prolonged period of time. Making the workout or exercise too intense can cause the training to focus more on anaerobic fitness instead of aerobic. </p>
                                    <p>The most important body part to train has to be your legs and in particular your glutes. Your legs are needed to propel you forward during running but also deliver the jumping power. This power will help you tremendously at multiple obstacles. So do not skip leg training!</p>
                                    <p>One fitness aspect which might be forgotten but has extremely high priority, is grip strength. Grip strength is needed for multiple obstacle, such as monkey bars, pull ups, rope climbs or obstacles as log or bucket carries. </p>
                                    <p class="tip">Tip: Keep the rep ranges high for exercises (at least 10 reps), do multiple exercises in a circuit, focus on full body or compound exercises and keep the rest periods between sets low for a good aerobic training!</p>
            
                                    <h5 id="run-training">Run Training</h5>
                                    <p>Although it is tempting to focus a lot on training for conquering obstacles, as completing the obstacles will probably give the biggest adrenaline kick. However, running covers the large majority of an obstacle race and thus run training requires at least as much, if not more, attention as your strength training.</p>
                                    <p>How much weekly running you should do, depends completely on the type of race you are participating. In obstacle races you have different types of races. A short, sprint type of course (3 – 5 miles/5 – 8 km), a middle distance (8 – 12 miles/12 – 16 km) and a long distance (13+ miles/18+ km). One thing to take into account is the longer the race, the lower the density of obstacles. This means that the focus will be relatively more on running in longer races and relatively more on your ability to tackle the obstacles in shorter races.</p>
                                    <p>In general, there are several types of run training. You have your easy run, fast run, long run, interval training, tempo runs, hill training and race training. All these different types of trainings focus on different aspects of running, some aspects are more important than others depending on the type of obstacle course you participate.</p>
                                    <p>One major mistake people often make during training is that they run too fast, as if they are in a race and want to set a PR. Although it is good to test your fitness once in a while with an up-tempo run or some racing, too much will not help you improve. Even worse, with a too high intensity you will get injured in the long run.</p>
                                    <p>Not only the length but also the focus of the obstacle course is of influence. Strong Viking, for example, has different types of obstacle races, the “water edition”, “mud edition”, “brother edition” and “hills edition”, respectively. Each type of obstacle race thus requires a different run training approach.
            
                                    <h5 id="last-tips">Last important tips</h5>
                                    <p>When you have trained for a couple weeks or months and the time has come to put the training into practice on race day it is important to take the following things into account. First, you have to have good race strategy, which includes how you pace your race, where you want to stop for drinks and how you are going to tackle certain obstacles.</p>
                                    <p>Warm up! Just as with every other sport, you need to properly warm up for the race to prevent injuries. Some running, dynamic flexibility exercises and some stretching are needed to get yourself loose and ready for the race.</p>
                                    <p>Even though you might want to conquer the course as fast as possible, safety should be your first priority. Each obstacle has certain risks to it and you want to minimize them as much as possible. If you have thought of a solid race strategy upfront, you not only know how you want to approach the obstacles but also what possible dangers might be. It is important that you take your time to complete an obstacle, as races are won in-between obstacles and not on the obstacles themselves. So no need to rush an obstacle. Last, do not hesitate to ask others to help you in order to complete the obstacle safely.</p>
                                    <p>As you want to be as best prepared for the obstacle course as you can be, the most important thing is to not get injured during training. Therefore, it is important to listen to your body at any moment and decrease the intensity of the workouts if you feel so. Getting injured can cost you weeks maybe even months of valuable training time. If you feel something is not right, take a step down or maybe even skip a workout or two, in the long run this will save you time. The worst thing that can happen is that you are injured and not able to compete at the obstacle course!</p>
                                    <p>If you managed to complete all the training without injuring yourself and you are totally ready to crush that obstacle course, then it is time for one last thing: enjoy the race! You may want to compete, beat the competition and do the best you can be. But enjoy doing so, you paid for a ticket to compete.</p>
                                    <p>Remember that the majority of OCR runners are beginners and you might be as well. But with good preparation, hard work and mental toughness you might surprise yourself on that course! So start today and get ready to dominate!</p>
