                        Obstacle Course Racing (OCR) is a sport in which a competitor, traveling on foot, must overcome various physical challenges in the form of obstacles.
                        Races vary from mostly obstacles such as American Ninja Warrior "Ninja Races", to track races, to urban and cross country events. In cross country events,
                        mud and trail runs are often combined and the races are designed to result in mental and physical collapse. Obstacles may include climbing over walls,
                        carrying heavy objects, traversing bodies of water, crawling under barbed wire, and jumping through fire. Many obstacles are similar to those used in military
                        training, while others are unique to obstacle racing and are employed throughout the course to test endurance, strength, speed and, dexterity.

                        Races vary in distance and difficulty, often combining trail running, road running, and cross country running. With race venues typically in sports stadiums,
                        ski resorts, cities and parks, organizers encourage athletes of all types to participate. Many military training obstacles were introduced into Cross Country
                        Running at Tough Guy. According to the Los Angeles Times in 2012, the number of events—typically all-day festivals—rose rapidly. Supporting the sports popularity,
                        several on-line magazines including Mud Run Guide[1] and Obstacle Racing Media[2] were launched. A print version Obstacle Race Magazine had a short run starting 2012.
                        Followed by OCRM Network in 2017, an Online Media Outlet dedicated to entertainment, information and Live Coverage of World OCR events that is breaking ground in Live
                        Streaming OCR Events, along with TV shows, TV Series and Documentaries on the Sport.
