                <h2>SPARTAN</h2>
                <p>It all started in the Green Mountains of Vermont when Spartan founder, Joe De Sena, became increasingly aware that humans are missing a critical component in the modern world. As we took steps forward technologically, holistic health took a step backward. Life is getting “easier”, but as a result, people are becoming overweight, depressed, lonely and less self-sufficient.</p>
                <p>Inspired by the warrior society of ancient Sparta, he set out to create a community of Spartans who push and inspire each other. Our Spartan obstacle courses seek to manufacture adversity, which then trains your body and mind to overcome obstacles on the course and in your everyday lives. Spartans develop a resilient spirit, a capable body and mind, all supported and driven by an incredible community.</p>
                <p>After our first obstacle course race in 2010, Spartan has grown to 250+ annual events across 42+ countries.</p>
